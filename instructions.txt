Practice: Dynamic Dashboard
Create a React component called DynamicDashboard that integrates the following skills:
1. Use JavaScript expressions in JSX to display dynamic data.
2. Implement conditional rendering for personalized content.
3. Use the map method to render a list dynamically.

===== INSTRUCTIONS =====
1. Dynamic Greeting:
    ○ Create a variable with a user’s name and initialize it
    ○ Render a dynamic greeting for the user inside an <h1> element.
2. Conditional Content:
    ○ Create a boolean variable to determine whether a user is a premium user or not.
    ○ If the user is a premium member, display a message: "Thank you for being a premium member!".
    ○ If not, display: "Upgrade to premium to enjoy exclusive features!".
3. Render a Task List:
    ○ Create an array of task objects, each with a taskName and completed status.
    ○ Use the map method to render each task of these in a list. Show the task name with:
        ■ A ✅ emoji if it’s completed.
        ■ A ❌ emoji if it’s not completed.
4. Combine Everything:
    ○ Display all the components (greeting, conditional message, and task list) within a <div> element.

Stretch Goals:
1. Add a Date Display:
    ○ Use new Date().toLocaleDateString() to display the current date at the top of the dashboard.
2. Highlight Completed Tasks:
    ○ Add inline styling to change the text color of completed tasks to green.
3. Display Task Counts:
    ○ Below the task list, show the number of completed and incomplete tasks.
